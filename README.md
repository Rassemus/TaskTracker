## Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> At the first startup, the internet connection must be on.
> 
> The service worker caches the data for offline access.

Locate root folder via terminal.

`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view project in your browser.

Start the JSON-server in another terminal.

The JSON-server uses port 3000 by default, let's change it to 8000 because 3000 is reserved.

`json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000`

The db.json file is located in a folder called data.

> [!TIP]
> You can also try the app without a JSON-server or offline.
